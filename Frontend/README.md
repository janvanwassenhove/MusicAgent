## Introduction
The MusicAgent web interface is a more simple way to interact with the MusicAgent. 
It allows you to create music, generate album covers, and more.

## Launching the agent

Running the web application will allow you to interact with the MusicAgent backend.

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
To simplify launch of the web app, you can also run  the `start_musicagent.bat` script in the main folder.
This will startup the web app, but also launch the backend application.

## Dashboard Setup

The dashboard foresees in multiple ways to follow up the song creation process by launching different widgets.

### Sonic Pi Code

The Sonic Pi widget enables to follow up the different versions of sonic pi code that is being generated by the MusicAgent.
It also allows to copy/paste or even send the code to the Sonic Pi IDE.
For the send option, you'll need to have the Sonic Pi IDE running and the listener script running (cf. [Sonic Pi Setup README](../SonicPi/Setup/README.md)).
